# ML Engineer Challenge - Intern

## Intro

Swissgrid took part in an Machine Learning Hackathon.
The results were very impressive and multiple internal stakeholders want to see the results on recent internal data instead of old data that was open sourced.

You get provided the folder structure and the python notebooks that the participants provided.

The goal of the challenge is to look over the results of the participants and provide the following deliverables:

1. Write a markdown document how you would approach this.
Focus on structural aspects of the code e.g. software engineering practices(code documentation, structure, ML frameworks etc.).
2. Refactor the provided scripts into a normal .py file (or files) focussing on your results from the first bullet point. Please only provide the py files, API wrapper and containerization is not needed at this stage.Don't focus on rewriting functionalities but on structure instead.
3. Pick out 1 to 2 functions in the scripts that you would change or that you think are missing and deliver them to us.

**Please invest no more than 2 hours for each part or 6 hours in total.**

## Where to find the results

## Evaluation criteria

What we're looking for:

* Clean project setup
* The ability to determine the actual problem area and find a suitable solution
* Scratch features when necessary, time is short!
* Document your approach, your decisions, and your general notes
* Give us some feedback on the challenge :)
