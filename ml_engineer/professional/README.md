# ML Engineer Challenge - Professional

## Intro

Swissgrid took part in an Machine Learning Hackathon.
The results were very impressive and multiple internal stakeholders want to see how the model perform in production.
You get provided the folder structure and the python notebooks that the participants provided.

The goal of the challenge is to look over the results of the participants and provide the following:

1. Your checklist to bring the model into production. Look over it, understand it, show potential problems with the model and so on an forth.
Think about architecture in production and choose your components wisely.
2. Wrap the model and everything you thought about in point one into an asynchronous API framework of your choice. We prefer this in Python but if you can argue other languages/frameworks please do so!
Implement typical endpoints that are needed in production.
3. Containerize the components and run them on your local machine.
4. Split some data from the data provided in the hackathon and simulate inference of the model.

You will present the deliverables at the start of the second interview.
Avoid Powerpoint at all costs!

**Please invest no more than 8 hours in total.**

## Where to find the hackathon results

* The hackathon result is actually real, the results can be found [here](https://github.com/Swissgrid-AG-External/energydatahackdays23/tree/d5f88f3ff117ffcaafd43167e6357f7a5bfbc4a2/group3).

## Evaluation criteria

What we're looking for:

* Clean project setup
* Necessary architecture components
* The ability to determine the actual problem area and find a suitable solution
* Scratch features when necessary, time is short!
* Document your approach, your decisions, and your general notes
* Give us some feedback on the challenge :)
